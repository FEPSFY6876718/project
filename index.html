    <h1><b><u>Abstract</u></b></h1>

    <h1><b><u> Introduction </u></b></h1>
    <h2>Space weather is caused by the behavior of the sun, the nature of Earth’s magnetic field and atmosphere, it is also based on our location in the solar system. Active elements of space weather such as particles, electromagnetic energy and magnetic fields. Magnetic fields, radiation, particles and matter which have been released from the Sun interact with the Earth’s magnetic field and above atmosphere to create different affects. (Met Office, n.d.) </h2>
    
    <h1><b><u> Why is Space Weather important?</u></b></h1>
    <h2><p>Space weather interacts with Earth’s atmosphere, as the solar wind flows past earth, it is mostly deflected around the Earth's magnetosphere, which is also known as the protective magnetic field that surrounds the planet. Bursts of solar energy that journey to Earth connect into the magnetosphere, sending particle radiation spiraling down with the planet’s magnetic field lines. As these radiation particles collide with atoms in Earth’s upper atmosphere, this can cause auroras (“light shows” in the sky) and can also interfere with satellites and electrical power grids on earth, which can cause outages. (Center for Science Education, n.d.) </p> 

        <p>As most of the weather is driven by the Sun, this also portrays the importance of Space Weather, this includes everything from window to rain patterns and comes from the way the Sun heats different parts of the planet. This can result in great heatwaves, or rainfall in certain parts of Earth, this can cause devastating issues.  (Center for Astrophysics, n.d.) </p>

        <p>Solar flares occur when intense magnetic fields on the Sun become too tangled, an example of this can be explained by a rubber band that snaps when it is twisted too far, the tangled magnetic fields release energy when they snap. The energy emitted by a solar flare compared to a volcano erupting is a million times stronger. These solar flares can cause radio blackouts, this is important as this can cut off communication, and harm satellite systems. (Center for Science Education, n.d.)</p> </h2>
  
    <h2><b><u> Notable Occurences in History Involving Space Weather </u></b></h2>  
    <p> 1859: The Carrington event: This was the most intense geomagnetic storm in recorded history, this event peaked on the 1st and 2nd of September during solar cycle 10. It created auroral displays that were reported and even caused fires in telegraph stations. (Wikipedia, 02/11/24)  </p>
    <p> 1921 – May 1921 Geomagnetic Storms – One of the most extreme known geomagnetic storms, this storm burnt out fuses, telephone stations and caused fires at signal towers and telegraph stations. This geomagnetic storm also created communication blackouts which lasted several hours. (Wikipedia, 10/07/24)  </p>
    <p> 1989 : Major power failures from geomagnetic storm – In March 1989, a powerful solar flare provoke a geomagnetic storm which set off a major power black out in Canada that left 6 million people without electricity for 9 hours. This solar flare melted some power transformers in New Jersey. (Space.com, 20/07/22)  </p>
    <p> 2006 : X-Ray sun flare for Xmas – When a major X-class solar flare erupted on the sun on December 5th 2006 it was registered as a powerful X9 on the space weather scale. This storm from the sun disrupted satellite-to-ground communications and GlPS navigation signals for 10 minutes. (Space.com, 20/07/22)  </p>
    <p> 2024 : May 2024 Solar Storms – Series of powerful solar storms with extreme solar flares and geomagnetic storm, this geomagnetic storm was the most powerful to affect Earth since March 1989. This storm produced auroras in the Northen and Southern Hempisheres (Wikipedia, 20/11/24 </p>
